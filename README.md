# freeCodeCamp-Responsive-Web-Design-Projects

Learning responsive web design with FreeCodeCamp projects and getting my first certification.<br>
All the projects is made with only practice in mind, so they are far from perfect.<br>
Also almost every piece of information that projects keeps in, is not real or relevant.
